            <p>I am a Colorado Native that enjoys the great outdoors, playing with yarn, sports,  and hanging with friends and family. I am the Operations Manager for a small IT recruiting company, mom of three, and left fielder. I enjoy a good pun, puzzles, and food. I am currently working towards a career change into the world of software and web development.</p>
            <p>I have been doing various administrative and office management positions since I began working for my dad at age 10. I have been in positions ranging from just answering phone calls to handling the entire office administration in addition to finance and accounting responsibilities. I am an excellent multi-tasker, and I set a high bar for my standards of success. I love working with people and making sure they have all the tools they need to meet their own standards of success. I am self motivated and have always been passionate about making a tangible impact wherever I am. I love to figure things out, learn new things, help people, and most importantly have fun.</p>
            <p>In my most current role I took ownership of invoicing and payroll for an IT staffing company. I reduced the entire process from two days to a few hours while increasing accuracy by digitizing the entire process. Prior to that, I have implemented organizational improvements and enhanced operating procedures in multiple departments (treasury, lending, office management) across multiple industries (energy and banking). I am always on the lookout for efficiency and progress.</p>
            <p> My previous work has set me up well for understanding multifaceted business operations and helped me grow to be a great team member for both the individual work groups as well as the company as a whole. </p>
