                  I am a Colorado Native that enjoys the great outdoors, playing
                  with yarn, sports, and hanging with friends and family. I am
                  the Operations Manager for a small IT recruiting company, mom
                  of three, and left fielder. I enjoy a good pun, puzzles, and
                  food. I am currently working towards a career change into the
                  world of software and web development.
                </p>

                  I have been doing various administrative and office management
                  positions since I began working for my dad at age 10. I have
                  been in positions ranging from just answering phone calls to
                  handling the entire office administration in addition to
                  finance and accounting responsibilities. I am an excellent
                  multi-tasker, and I set a high bar for my standards of
                  success. I love working with people and making sure they have
                  all the tools they need to meet their own standards of
                  success. I am self motivated and have always been passionate
                  about making a tangible impact wherever I am. I love to figure
                  things out, learn new things, help people, and most
                  importantly have fun.
                </p>

                  In my most current role I took ownership of invoicing and
                  payroll for an IT staffing company. I reduced the entire
                  process from two days to a few hours while increasing accuracy
                  by digitizing the entire process. Prior to that, I have
                  implemented organizational improvements and enhanced operating
                  procedures in multiple departments (treasury, lending, office
                  management) across multiple industries (energy and banking). I
                  am always on the lookout for efficiency and progress.
                </p>

                  My previous work has set me up well for understanding
                  multifaceted business operations and helped me grow to be a
                  great team member for both the individual work groups as well
                  as the company as a whole.
